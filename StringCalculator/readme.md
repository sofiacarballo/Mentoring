# StringCalculator Kata

This is an incremental kata, meaning that you should no read step 2 before finishing step 1.

### Step 1:

Write a function add() that takes up to two numbers (separated by commas) as string, and returns their sum.
For example:
- "" will return 0.
- "1" will return 1.
- "1,2" will return 3.

### Step 2:

Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.

### Step 3:

Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas):
For example:
- "1\n2,3" will return 6.

### Step 4:

Support different delimiters:

### Step 5:

Calling add with negative numbers will throw and Exception: 'Negatives not allowed'.

### Step 6:

Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
